# waypoint-nav
This repository is a lightweight Python simulator for a 3D Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) navigating a series of waypoints. It features a kinematic UAV model controlled by PID controllers, a simple physics and environment model, and cubic spline interpolation for smooth path generation. The simulation is visualised in real-time.
